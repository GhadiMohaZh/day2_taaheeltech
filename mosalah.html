       <h1>About MO Salah</h1> 
       <p><b><i>Mohamed Salah Ghaly</i></b> (born 15 July 1992) is an Egyptian international footballer who plays as a winger for <a href="#">Liverpool</a>, 
        having arrived from Roma for a reported fee of £36,900,000 in 2017. A club record signing at the time, 
        Salah took Liverpool and the Premier League by storm, grabbing 44 goals in his debut season, 
        winning the PFA Player of the Year and helping Liverpool to the <a href="#">Champions League Final</a>.
         Despite disappointment at that attempt, the Egyptian came back strong, and netted in the following final, 
         leading Liverpool to a sixth European Cup triumph, as well as collecting a second Golden Boot in the Premier League.</p>
